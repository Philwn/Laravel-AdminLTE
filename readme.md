## Laravel and AdminLTE Theme CMS

After recently moving to Laravel PHP framework and creating a couple of projects involving a CMS Panel i decided to create a "Boiler Plate" for how they usually work. This package uses and includes an Open Source Bootstrap admin Theme call AdminLTE which also uses a combination of javascript/jquery plugins. This package is meant to provide me with a quick start when producing a new project that requires a CMS

## Resources

This Package uses the following (possibly more depending on what AdminLTE ships with)

[Laravel](http://laravel.com)  (version 5.1.26 (LTS))
The PHP framework of choice

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) Version(3.3.5)
Bootstrap ships with Laravel anyway and the free admin theme is also based on Bootstrap 3

[AdminLTE](https://almsaeedstudio.com/)  (version 2.3.2)
Free Open source Bootstrap Admin Theme

[CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/)
Used as my Content Editor within the CMS, Shipped with AdminLTE Theme.

[dataTables](https://datatables.net/) (version 1.10.7)
