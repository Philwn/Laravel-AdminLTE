## Laravel and AdminLTE Theme CMS

After recently moving to Laravel PHP framework and creating a couple of projects involving a CMS Panel i decided to create a "Boiler Plate" for how they usually work. This package uses and includes an Open Source Bootstrap admin Theme call AdminLTE which also uses a combination of javascript/jquery plugins. This package is meant to provide me with a quick start when producing a new project that requires a CMS

## Resources
